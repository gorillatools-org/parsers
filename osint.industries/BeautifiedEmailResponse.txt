    Description: In March 2024, tens of millions of records allegedly breached from AT&T were posted to a popular hacking forum. Dating back to August 2021, the data was originally posted for sale before later being freely released. At the time, AT&T maintained that there had not been a breach of their systems and that the data originated from elsewhere. 12 days later, AT&T acknowledged that data fields specific to them were in the breach and that it was not yet known whether the breach occurred at their end or that of a vendor. AT&T also proceeded to reset customer account passcodes, an indicator that there was sufficient belief passcodes had been compromised. The incident exposed names, email and physical addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers and US social security numbers.

    Description: In early 2023, over 200M records scraped from Twitter appeared on a popular hacking forum. The data was obtained sometime in 2021 by abusing an API that enabled email addresses to be resolved to Twitter profiles. The subsequent results were then composed into a corpus of data containing email addresses alongside public Twitter profile information including names, usernames and follower counts.

    comment: People will tell you something is not in stock just to get you to stop talking to them. Only 3 registers open during peak hours. There was one employee who was nice and helpful to the point I was actually shocked. Its sad that its expected that their customer service is supposed to be so bad that when you actually do get good service you are shocked. Plus after 9 none of my friends or family feel safe going there. Be careful.

    comment: Very fun experience. The course is pretty hard but if you take your time and dont over think it you can beat it. We did the Blackbeard one. Definitely recommend it.

    comment: The theatre is very nice, they have leather reclining seats and food is fairly priced for a theatre, but the mens room could use a little tlc when I went.
